###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two suspects are arrested and interrogated separately. Each can either confess or remain silent. If both suspects remain silent, they each receive a minor sentence of 1 year in prison. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free while the silent one receives a heavy sentence of 10 years. If both confess, they each receive a moderate sentence of 5 years. This situation, known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, demonstrates how individual rationality can lead to a worse collective outcome.


Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
To define the domain-specific axioms for the given Prisoner's Dilemma game using numerical payoffs, I have created the following Prolog code. This set includes the necessary preconditions and effects for each game action and matchup outcomes. Below is the complete implementation, which should be compatible with SWI Prolog.

```prolog
@
:- discontiguous p/3.
/* Domain Specific Axioms for Prisoner's Dilemma */

/* Payoff matrix for PD with numerical payoffs representing the years of prison */
payoffPD('D', 'D', 5, 5).  % Both confess: moderate sentence
payoffPD('C', 'D', 10, 0). % Silent and the other confesses: silent gets heavy sentence, confessor goes free
payoffPD('D', 'C', 0, 10). % Confessor goes free, silent gets heavy sentence
payoffPD('C', 'C', 1, 1).  % Both remain silent: minor sentence

/* Initial state */
initial(s0).

/* What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play. */
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, row), s0).
initially(role(p2, col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

/* When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2, implying it is a legal state. */
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

/* A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn). */
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

/* What is possible for a player to choose */
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

/* The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this is what they did. */
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

/* The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e., cannot move anymore. */
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

/* What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities. */
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

/* Goals achieved by the players. */
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).

This implementation uses the existing structure of the game, tweaking the payoff details to reflect the new prisoner's dilemma scenario described. The payoff matrix now reflects the years of prison for each outcome.

To use this code within your SWI Prolog environment, copy it between the '@' markers into a .pl file or your Prolog interpreter, ensuring no syntax errors are present.~
