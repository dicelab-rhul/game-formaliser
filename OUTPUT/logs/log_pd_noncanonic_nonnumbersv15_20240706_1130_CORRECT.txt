###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two corporations must decide whether to implement costly sustainable practices or continue cheaper, unsustainable methods. If both adopt sustainable practices, they build better reputations and contribute to environmental preservation. If one does and the other doesnâ€™t, the adopter incurs higher costs and may lose competitive pricing, while the non-adopter enjoys lower costs and possible short-term gains. If neither adopts sustainable practices, they both save money but contribute to environmental degradation and potential future regulatory issues.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
Here is a set of domain-specific axioms for the new game, as described in the verbal description. This version is written to be compatible with SWI Prolog, and assumes the general structure of your previous program for the Prisoner's Dilemma game. The payoffs are assumed based on the usual setup of such games:

```prolog
@  

% Declare discontiguous predicates
:- discontiguous payoff/4.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

% Payoff matrix for the sustainability game
payoffSustainability('S', 'S', 5, 5). % Both adopt sustainable practices
payoffSustainability('U', 'S', 8, 2). % One adopts sustainable, the other unsustainable
payoffSustainability('S', 'U', 2, 8). % One adopts unsustainable, the other sustainable
payoffSustainability('U', 'U', 3, 3). % Both adopt unsustainable practices

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(corp1), s0).
initially(player(corp2), s0).
initially(role(corp1, row), s0).
initially(role(corp2, col), s0).
initially(control(corp1), s0).
initially(control(corp2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_Corp2, _M2), do(choice(_Corp1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(Corp, M), S):- possible(choice(Corp, M), S), holds(control(Corp), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(Corp,'S'), S):- holds(player(Corp), S).
possible(choice(Corp,'U'), S):- holds(player(Corp), S).

% The effects of a move: if Corp has chosen M, then in the next state this is what they did.
effect(did(Corp, M), choice(Corp, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.,
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(Corp), choice(Corp, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(Corp1, M1, U1, Corp2, M2, U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(Corp1, row), S),	
	holds(did(Corp1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(Corp2, col), S),	
	holds(did(Corp2, M2), S),
	payoffSustainability(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(Corp1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(Corp1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(Corp2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_, _, _, Corp2, _, U2), S).

```

In this version:

- `s` (Sustainable) and `u` (Unsustainable) are used for the choices.
- The payoff for the sustainability game is provided using numerical values based on the description.
- The players are `corp1` and `corp2`, representing two corporations.
- The roles (`row`, `col`) help distinguish the players in the payoff matrix.

This should correctly model the new game, using the provided structure and rules from the initial Prisoner's Dilemma example.~
