###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two employees are working on a joint project and must decide whether to share all their innovative ideas or keep some to themselves for credit. If both share openly, the project flourishes and they achieve great results, earning joint recognition. If one shares while the other withholds, the sharer contributes more but feels exploited, while the withholder benefits more and gains more recognition. If neither shares openly, the project suffers, and they both receive mediocre evaluations.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Below is the set of domain-specific axioms for the game with employees sharing innovative ideas. I've ensured that the code is compatible with SWI Prolog and included the appropriate use of the `discontiguous` declaration where necessary.

```prolog
@

:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous payoff/4.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

/* Game specific predicates for the innovative ideas sharing game */

/* Payoff matrix for the game */
payoff('D', 'D', 2, 2).   % Both withhold
payoff('C', 'D', 1, 4).   % P1 shares, P2 withholds
payoff('D', 'C', 4, 1).   % P1 withholds, P2 shares
payoff('C', 'C', 3, 3).   % Both share

/* Initial state */
initial(s0).

/* What holds initially: who is an employee, their role, and whether they can act. */
initially(employee(e1), s0).
initially(employee(e2), s0).
initially(role(e1,row), s0).
initially(role(e2,col), s0).
initially(control(e1), s0).
initially(control(e2), s0).

/* When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
implying it is a legal state. */
final(do(choice(_E2, _M2), do(choice(_E1, _M1), S))):- initial(S).

/* A legal move is a possible move where the employee has control (is its turn). */
legal(choice(E, M), S):- possible(choice(E, M), S), holds(control(E), S).

/* What is possible for an employee to choose */
possible(choice(E,'D'), S):- holds(employee(E), S).
possible(choice(E,'C'), S):- holds(employee(E), S).

/* The effects of a move: if E has chosen M, then in the next state this
is what they did. */
effect(did(E, M), choice(E, M), _S).

/* The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the employee loses control, i.e.
cannot move anymore. */
abnormal(control(E), choice(E, _M), _S).

/* What holds finally: the outcome with employees, Moves, and Utilities. */
finally(outcome(E1, M1, U1, E2, M2, U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(E1, row), S),
    holds(did(E1, M1), S),
    holds(role(E2, col), S),
    holds(did(E2, M2), S),
    payoff(M1, M2, U1, U2).

/* Goals achieved by the employees. */
finally(goal(E1, U1), S):-
    finally(outcome(E1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(E2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, E2, _, U2), S).

This Prolog code defines the domain-specific axioms for the game involving employees deciding whether to share all their innovative ideas or keep some to themselves. Each employee can either choose to share ('C') or withhold ('D'). The payoffs depend on their respective choices, and the code adheres to the structure defined by the situation calculus for games.~
