###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two neighboring cities must decide whether to jointly fund a major infrastructure project like a bridge that benefits both. If both cities fund the project, they share the costs and benefits, each receiving a payoff of 6. If one city funds the project while the other does not, the funding city bears the full cost but still benefits from the use of the bridge, receiving a payoff of 4, while the non-funding city benefits without any cost, receiving a payoff of 8. If neither city funds the project, the bridge is not built, and both cities receive a payoff of 0.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
To model the specified game in the situation calculus for Prolog, you'll need to provide the required domain-specific axioms. Here's the code segment which defines these axioms for the Neighboring Cities' Bridge Funding game. The code is compatible with SWI Prolog, including the necessary discontiguous declarations for the predicates:

```prolog
@ 
:- discontiguous p/3.

/* Game specific predicates for Neighboring Cities' Bridge Funding Game */

% Payoff matrix for the bridge funding game
payoffBridge('Fund', 'Fund', 6, 6).
payoffBridge('NotFund', 'Fund', 8, 4).
payoffBridge('Fund', 'NotFund', 4, 8).
payoffBridge('NotFund', 'NotFund', 0, 0).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(city1), s0).
initially(player(city2), s0).
initially(role(city1, funder), s0).
initially(role(city2, fundee), s0).
initially(control(city1), s0).
initially(control(city2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it is generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_City2, _M2), do(choice(_City1, _M1), S))) :- initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(City, M), S) :- possible(choice(City, M), S), holds(control(City), S).

% What is possible for a city to choose
possible(choice(City, 'Fund'), S) :- holds(player(City), S).
possible(choice(City, 'NotFund'), S) :- holds(player(City), S).

% The effects of a move: if a city has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(City, M), choice(City, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(City), choice(City, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, moves, and utilities.
finally(outcome(City1, M1, U1, City2, M2, U2), S) :-
    final(S),
    holds(role(City1, funder), S),
    holds(did(City1, M1), S),
    holds(role(City2, fundee), S),
    holds(did(City2, M2), S),
    payoffBridge(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(City1, U1), S) :-
    finally(outcome(City1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(City2, U2), S) :-
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, City2, _, U2), S).
@
```

In this code:

- The payoff matrix (`payoffBridge/4`) is defined based on the given payoffs for different choices of each city.
- Initial conditions set up the initial state (`initial/1`), roles, and controls for the players.
- Legal moves are determined based on control and possibility predicates (`legal/2`, `possible/2`).
- Effects of actions and consequences on control are defined via `effect/3` and `abnormal/3`.
- Finally, the outcomes and goals of the game are defined using `finally/2` and `finally/1` predicates to establish what holds at the end of the game.

This code is enclosed within `@` markers, indicating the beginning and the end of the domain-specific axioms. It should work directly with SWI Prolog for generating and testing all legal evolutions of this specific game.~
