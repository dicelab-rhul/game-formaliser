###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two environmental organizations are faced with a major conservation challenge, such as saving an endangered species. By joining forces, they can pool resources and expertise to create a comprehensive conservation plan, leading to a high reward of media attention, funding, and notable success. If one organization devotes efforts to the joint project while the other focuses on smaller, guaranteed projects, the collaborator might see their effort go to waste, while the other organization secures a moderate reward. If both work independently, they achieve smaller, localized successes and gain minimal recognition.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
Here is the set of domain-specific axioms for the environmental organizations conservation challenge game, marked with the beginning and end of the code using '@'. I have made the code compatible with SWI Prolog:

```prolog
@ 
:- discontiguous payoff_env/4, initially/2, initial/1, final/1, legal/2, possible/2, effect/3, abnormal/3, finally/2, finally/1. 

/* Domain Specific Predicates for Environmental Organizations Conservation Game (ENV) */

% Payoff matrix for ENV
payoff_env('Independent', 'Independent', 1, 1).
payoff_env('Collaborate', 'Independent', 0, 3).
payoff_env('Independent', 'Collaborate', 3, 0).
payoff_env('Collaborate', 'Collaborate', 5, 5).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.    
initially(player(org1), s0).
initially(player(org2), s0).
initially(role(org1, row), s0).
initially(role(org2, col), s0).
initially(control(org1), s0).
initially(control(org2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'Independent'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'Collaborate'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),    
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),    
    holds(role(P2, col), S),    
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoff_env(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
    finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).

This code defines the logic for the environmental organizations conservation challenge game with numerical payoffs. The predicates and clauses are structured similarly to the Prisoner's Dilemma game example provided. The payoffs have been encoded to correspond to the gameâ€™s outcomes based on the provided verbal description.~
