###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

A landlord and a tenant are negotiating the terms of a lease renewal. They can either compromise on the rent increase or hold firm on their initial offers. If both compromise, a moderate rent increase is agreed upon. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gets their desired rent or lease terms. If both hold firm, the lease is not renewed, leading the tenant to move out and the landlord to lose rental income temporarily.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Here are the set of domain-specific axioms for the landlord-tenant negotiation game with numerical payoffs. The code is enclosed between '@' as requested:

```prolog
@
:- discontiguous holds/2.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

% Payoff matrix for Landlord-Tenant Negotiation (LTN)
payoffLTN('Firm', 'Firm', 0, 0).    % Both hold firm, lease not renewed
payoffLTN('Compromise', 'Firm', 1, 3). % Tenant compromises, landlord holds firm
payoffLTN('Firm', 'Compromise', 3, 1). % Tenant holds firm, landlord compromises
payoffLTN('Compromise', 'Compromise', 2, 2). % Both compromise, moderate rent increase

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.    
initially(player(landlord), s0).
initially(player(tenant), s0).
initially(role(landlord,row), s0).
initially(role(tenant,col), s0).
initially(control(landlord), s0).
initially(control(tenant), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it is generated by game/2
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, 'Firm'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'Compromise'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),    
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),    
    holds(role(P2, col), S),    
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoffLTN(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
    finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).

```

In this game, the players are the landlord and the tenant, and they can choose to either 'Firm' or 'Compromise'. The payoffs are defined in the `payoffLTN` predicate. The rest of the code follows a similar structure to the provided prisoner's dilemma example, with necessary adjustments for this specific game scenario. This code should be compatible with SWI Prolog.~
