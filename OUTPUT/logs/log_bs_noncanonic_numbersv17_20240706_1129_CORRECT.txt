###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two siblings are deciding on a family vacation location. One prefers Disneyland for its thrill rides, while the other loves Yellowstone for its natural beauty. They both agree that spending time together is more important. If they pick Disneyland, the amusement park fan earns 2 points, and the nature lover gets 1 point. If they choose Yellowstone, the nature enthusiast gets 2 points, and the thrill-seeker gets 1 point. If they go to different places, they don't have a family vacation, both scoring 0 points.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Below are the domain-specific axioms for the described family vacation game. I've marked the beginning and end of the code with a '@' and added the necessary discontiguous declarations to ensure compatibility with SWI Prolog.

```prolog
@
:- discontiguous initial/1.
:- discontiguous holds/2.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous finally/2.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous payoffFamilyVacation/4.

% Domain-specific predicates for Family Vacation Game

% Payoff matrix for Family Vacation
payoffFamilyVacation('D', 'D', 0, 0).
payoffFamilyVacation('Y', 'D', 0, 0).
payoffFamilyVacation('D', 'Y', 0, 0).
payoffFamilyVacation('Y', 'Y', 2, 2).
payoffFamilyVacation('D', 'Y', 1, 2).
payoffFamilyVacation('Y', 'D', 2, 1).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, amusement), s0).
initially(role(p2, nature), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):- initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, 'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'Y'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.,
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, amusement), S),
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),
	holds(role(P2, nature), S),
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffFamilyVacation(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).

```

This code defines the family vacation game using the descriptions provided, including the roles of the players, the possible choices, the final states, and the payoffs for each outcome. The `discontiguous` declarations ensure that the predicates can be spread across the file without issues in SWI Prolog.~
