###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

In this sequential game, Player A moves first and chooses to either cooperate (C) or defect (D). Player B, aware of Player A's decision, then makes their choice. If both cooperate (C, C), they each receive 3 points. If Player A cooperates but Player B defects (C, D), Player A gets 0 points and Player B gets 5 points. Conversely, if Player A defects and Player B cooperates (D, C), Player A gets 5 points and Player B gets 0 points. If both defect (D, D), they each receive 1 point.


Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
Certainly! Below is the set of domain-specific axioms for the described sequential game. The code is compatible with SWI Prolog and includes discontiguous declarations where necessary.

```prolog

:- discontiguous initial/1.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% is what they did.

% cannot move anymore. Player B gets control after Player A's move.

This code defines the specific rules for the described sequential game in the situation calculus framework and is designed to work in SWI Prolog. The `@` characters mark the beginning and end of the relevant code segment, following your instructions.~
