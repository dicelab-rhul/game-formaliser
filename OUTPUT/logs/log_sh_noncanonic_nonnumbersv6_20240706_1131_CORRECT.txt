###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

During a critical campaign, two allied generals must decide whether to plan a joint, large-scale attack or to conduct separate, safer operations. Coordinating their forces could lead to a decisive victory with considerable strategic advantage and medals of honor. If one general commits to the joint attack and the other does not, the first general's forces might be left exposed, achieving nothing, while the other gains a modest victory. If both pursue independent missions, they achieve minor successes but fail to make a significant impact.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Sure! Based on the verbal description of the new game, here is the domain-specific Prolog code for the generals' decision-making scenario. This code should be compatible with SWI Prolog. We'll use a set of numerical payoffs analogous to the payoff matrix from the Prisoner's Dilemma example.

```prolog
@  % Beginning of the domain-specific axioms for the generals' decision-making game

% Declarative directive to allow discontiguous predicates
:- discontiguous payoffGen/4, final/1, legal/2, possible/2, effect/3, abnormal/3, finally/2, initially/2.

% Payoff matrix for the generals' decision-making game
payoffGen('Coord', 'Coord', 5, 5).
payoffGen('Coord', 'Indep', 0, 3).
payoffGen('Indep', 'Coord', 3, 0).
payoffGen('Indep', 'Indep', 2, 2).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a general, their role, and whether they can plan.
initially(general(g1), s0).
initially(general(g2), s0).
initially(role(g1,row), s0).
initially(role(g2,col), s0).
initially(control(g1), s0).
initially(control(g2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it is generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_G2, _M2), do(choice(_G1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the general has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(G, M), S):- possible(choice(G, M), S), holds(control(G), S).

% What is possible for a general to choose
possible(choice(G,'Coord'), S):- holds(general(G), S).
possible(choice(G,'Indep'), S):- holds(general(G), S).

% The effects of a move: if G has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(G, M), choice(G, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the general loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(G), choice(G, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with generals, Moves, and Payoffs.
finally(outcome(G1, M1, P1, G2, M2, P2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(G1, row), S),	
	holds(did(G1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(G2, col), S),	
	holds(did(G2, M2), S),
	payoffGen(M1, M2, P1, P2).

% Goals achieved by the generals.
finally(goal(G1, P1), S):-
	finally(outcome(G1,_,P1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(G2, P2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,G2,_,P2), S).

@  % End of the domain-specific axioms for the generals' decision-making game
```

This Prolog code defines the domain-specific predicates and rules for the new game involving two generals making strategic decisions about whether to coordinate or act independently. The payoffs have been specified according to the game's description. The structure of the code mirrors the structure provided for the Prisoner's Dilemma, while keeping the specifics relevant to the generals' scenario.~
