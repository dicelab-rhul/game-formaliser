###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

A couple is deciding how to spend their evening together. One prefers to go to the opera and the other prefers to go to a football game, but both prefer to be together rather than apart. If they both choose the opera, the opera lover gets a payoff of 2 units of happiness, and the football lover gets 1 unit. If they both choose the football game, the football lover gets 2 units of happiness, and the opera lover gets 1 unit. If they choose different events, they both get 0 units of happiness. This situation, known as the Battle of the Sexes, reflects the challenges of coordinating when preferences differ.


Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

Okay, let's create the set of domain-specific axioms for the "Battle of the Sexes" game. We will use numerical payoffs as specified in the verbal description.

Here is the set of axioms and predicates marked between '@' for the "Battle of the Sexes" game, in a format compatible with SWI-Prolog:

```prolog
@ 

% Declare discontiguous predicates
:- discontiguous payoffBOS/4.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

% Payoff matrix for Battle of the Sexes (BOS)
payoffBOS(opera, opera, 2, 1).
payoffBOS(football, football, 1, 2).
payoffBOS(opera, football, 0, 0).
payoffBOS(football, opera, 0, 0).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play. 
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, opera_lover), s0).
initially(role(p2, football_lover), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it is generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, opera), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, football), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.,
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, opera_lover), S),
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),
	holds(role(P2, football_lover), S),
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffBOS(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).

This Prolog code defines the "Battle of the Sexes" game according to the game schema described earlier. It specifies the payoffs, the possible actions (choices), the effects of those actions, and what constitutes a final state. Adjustments to this template can be made for other games by defining the appropriate payoffs and player roles.~
