###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

A couple is deciding how to spend their evening together. One prefers to go to the opera and the other prefers to go to a football game, but both prefer to be together rather than apart. If they both choose the opera, the opera lover gets a higher payoff and the football lover gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the football game, the football lover gets a higher payoff and the opera lover gets a lower payoff. If they choose different events, they both get no payoff. This situation, known as the Battle of the Sexes, reflects the challenges of coordinating when preferences differ.


Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

Sure! Here's the domain specific axioms for the "Battle of the Sexes" game, following the structure and conventions from the Prisoner's Dilemma example. 

```prolog
@ % Start of the Battle of the Sexes game specification

:- discontiguous player/1, role/2, control/1, payoffBoS/4.

% Payoff matrix for Battle of the Sexes (BoS)
payoffBoS('O', 'O', 4, 3).
payoffBoS('F', 'F', 3, 4).
payoffBoS('O', 'F', 0, 0).
payoffBoS('F', 'O', 0, 0).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.  
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, row), s0).
initially(role(p2, col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, 'O'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'F'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),  
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),  
    holds(role(P2, col), S),  
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),

    finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).

This code provides the domain specific axioms necessary to define the "Battle of the Sexes" game within the framework provided. It includes the initial state, the moves available to the players, and the resulting payoffs based on their choices. 

Note: Ensure that this code snippet is integrated with the domain-independent situation calculus and legal evolution generator code provided at the beginning.~
