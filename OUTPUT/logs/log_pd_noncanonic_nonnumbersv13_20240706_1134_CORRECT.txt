###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two neighbors must decide whether to report their true income on their taxes or underreport to pay less. If both report truthfully, they contribute fairly to public services and avoid legal trouble. If one reports truthfully and the other underreports, the honest taxpayer feels cheated and subsidizes the public services for both. If neither reports accurately, they both save money but contribute to public service deficits and risk severe penalties if caught.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Sure, here is how you can implement the given game using the situation calculus in SWI-Prolog:

```prolog
@ 
:- discontiguous holds/2, initially/2, final/1, legal/2, possible/2, effect/3, abnormal/3, finally/2.

% ----------------------------------
% Payoff matrix for the new game
% ----------------------------------
payoffTax('truth', 'truth', 2, 2).
payoffTax('truth', 'underreport', 1, 3).
payoffTax('underreport', 'truth', 3, 1).
payoffTax('underreport', 'underreport', 1, 1).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, row), s0).
initially(role(p2, col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it's generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))) :- initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S) :- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose: 'truth' or 'underreport'
possible(choice(P, 'truth'), S) :- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'underreport'), S) :- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S) :-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),    
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),    
    holds(role(P2, col), S),    
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoffTax(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S) :- 
    finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S) :- 
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).
@ 
```

Explanation:
1. **Payoff Matrix**: The payoffs are encoded as numerical values representing the various outcomes.
2. **Initial State**: The initial state is defined using the `initial(s0)` and `initially/2` predicates.
3. **Final State**: Defined using the `final/1` predicate.
4. **Legal Moves**: Defined using `legal/2` and `possible/2` predicates, allowing 'truth' and 'underreport' choices.
5. **Effects and Abnormal Conditions**: Defined using `effect/3` and `abnormal/3` predicates respectively.
6. **Outcomes and Goals**: Defined using `finally/2` to determine the final state and goals.

This setup accurately represents the given game in the situation calculus framework compatible with SWI Prolog.~
