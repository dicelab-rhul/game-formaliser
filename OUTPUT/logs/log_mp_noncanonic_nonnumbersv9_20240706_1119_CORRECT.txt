###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

An independent film studio and a major Hollywood studio each decide independently whether to release their new film on a coveted holiday weekend or a regular weekend. If both releases coincide, the independent film garners unexpected attention and profits due to genre-specific audiences, affecting the major studio negatively. If the release dates differ, the Hollywood studio enjoys the bulk of the holiday weekend's ticket sales.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Here is the set of domain-specific axioms for the new game described, following the mentioned structure. This new game will be referred to as the "Release Date Game."

```prolog
@ 
:- discontiguous initial/1, initially/2, final/1, legal/2, possible/2, effect/3, abnormal/3, finally/2.

% Payoff matrix for Release Date Game
payoffRD('Holiday_Holiday', -1, 3).
payoffRD('Holiday_Regular', 5, 2).
payoffRD('Regular_Holiday', 2, 5).
payoffRD('Regular_Regular', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, studio1), s0).
initially(role(p2, studio2), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2, implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):- initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, 'Holiday'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'Regular'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e. cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S):- 
    final(S), 
    holds(role(P1, studio1), S),
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),
    holds(role(P2, studio2), S),
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    atom_concat(M1, '_', Temp),
    atom_concat(Temp, M2, CombinedMove),
    payoffRD(CombinedMove, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):- 
    finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):- 
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).

In this script:
- Two players, `p1` (independent film studio) and `p2` (major Hollywood studio), each decide on a release date (`Holiday` or `Regular`).
- The payoffs are consistent with the described scenario.
- `payoffRD/3` defines the payoff matrix based on the combined choice of both players.
- `initial/1` and `initially/2` set up the initial state.
- `final/1`, `legal/2`, `possible/2`, `effect/3`, and `abnormal/3` follow the pattern in the original script to specify the rules of the game.
- `finally/2` is used to specify the final outcomes and goals for each player.

This Prolog code defines the game's dynamics and can be used to generate or test all legal evolutions of the specified game.~
