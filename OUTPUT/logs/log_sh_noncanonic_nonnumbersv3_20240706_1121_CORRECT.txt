###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two candidates in the same political party must decide whether to work together to promote a unified platform, aiming for a major electoral win, or to focus on their individual political careers. Collaboration could lead to a landslide victory for the party and prominent roles for both candidates. If one invests in the joint platform while the other focuses on personal gain, the collaborator may struggle to gain traction, while the independent candidate secures a moderate win. If both pursue their own agendas, they risk splitting the vote and both suffering from diluted support.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
Here's the set of domain-specific axioms for the described game. I've marked the beginning and end of the code with '@' and used the `discontiguous` declaration for clarity and compatibility with SWI Prolog.

```prolog
@
:- discontiguous holds/2.
:- discontiguous finally/2.
:- discontiguous payoffPL/6.

% Payoff matrix for the Political Landscape game
payoffPL('individual', 'individual', 1, 1).
payoffPL('unity', 'individual', 0, 3).
payoffPL('individual', 'unity', 3, 0).
payoffPL('unity', 'unity', 4, 4).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, row), s0).
initially(role(p2, col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))) :- initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S) :- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P, 'individual'), S) :- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P, 'unity'), S) :- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1, M1, U1, P2, M2, U2), S) :-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),
    holds(role(P2, col), S),
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoffPL(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S) :-
    finally(outcome(P1, _, U1, _, _, _), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S) :-
    finally(outcome(_, _, _, P2, _, U2), S).

Explanation of the Clauses:

1. **Payoff Matrix (payoffPL/6)**: Specifies the possible payoffs for each combination of strategies chosen by the two players.

2. **Initial State (initial/1)**: Defines the initial situation (`s0`).

3. **Initially Holds (initially/2)**: Specifies facts that hold initially in the game, defining players, roles, and control.

4. **Final State (final/1)**: Defines the final state of the game when both players have made their choices.

5. **Legal Moves (legal/2 and possible/2)**: Determines what moves (choices) are legal for each player based on their current state and control.

6. **Effects of a Move (effect/3)**: States the effects of a player making a particular move.

7. **Abnormal Fluents (abnormal/3)**: Specifies when a player loses control after making a choice.

8. **Final Outcomes (finally/2)**: Specifies the outcome of the game, including the moves made and the payoffs received.

This provides a complete prediction model for the political landscape game as described, compatible with SWI Prolog.~
