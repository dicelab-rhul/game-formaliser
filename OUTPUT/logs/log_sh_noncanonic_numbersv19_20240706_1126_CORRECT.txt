###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two film directors are approached to co-direct a high-budget, potentially award-winning film. If both commit to the project, they produce a critically acclaimed movie, each earning prestigious awards worth 7 points. If one devotes full effort while the other disengages, the committed director's vision gets compromised, and they gain nothing (0 points), while the disengaged director reaps moderate career benefits worth 3 points from other projects. If they both decide to focus on their films rather than collaborate, they produce average movies, earning minimal critical acclaim worth 2 points each.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

RESPONSE##
Sure, I'll provide the domain-specific axioms for the new game based on the verbal description using a format compatible with SWI-Prolog. The game will be structured similarly to the Prisoner's Dilemma game, with custom payoff matrices and initial settings. Here is the complete code:

```prolog
@  
/* Game specific predicates for the Film Directors Game */
:- discontiguous payoffFD/4.
:- discontiguous initial/1.
:- discontiguous initially/2.
:- discontiguous final/1.
:- discontiguous legal/2.
:- discontiguous possible/2.
:- discontiguous effect/3.
:- discontiguous abnormal/3.
:- discontiguous finally/2.

/* Payoff matrix for the Film Directors Game */
payoffFD(commit, commit, 7, 7).
payoffFD(commit, disengage, 0, 3).
payoffFD(disengage, commit, 3, 0).
payoffFD(disengage, disengage, 2, 2).

/* Initial state */
initial(s0).

/* What holds initially: who is a director, their role, and whether they can decide. */
initially(director(d1), s0).
initially(director(d2), s0).
initially(role(d1, row), s0).
initially(role(d2, col), s0).
initially(control(d1), s0).
initially(control(d2), s0).

/* When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
implying it is a legal state. */
final(do(choice(_D2, _M2), do(choice(_D1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

/* A legal move is a possible move where the director has control (is its turn). */
legal(choice(D, M), S):- possible(choice(D, M), S), holds(control(D), S).

/* What is possible for a director to choose */
possible(choice(D, commit), S):- holds(director(D), S).
possible(choice(D, disengage), S):- holds(director(D), S).

/* The effects of a move: if D has chosen M, then in the next state this is what they did. */
effect(did(D, M), choice(D, M), _S).

/* The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the director loses control, i.e.
cannot move anymore. */
abnormal(control(D), choice(D, _M), _S).

/* What holds finally: the outcome with directors, Moves, and Utilities. */
finally(outcome(D1,M1,U1,D2,M2,U2), S):-
  final(S),
  holds(role(D1, row), S),	
  holds(did(D1, M1), S),	
  holds(role(D2, col), S),	
  holds(did(D2, M2), S),
  payoffFD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

/* Goals achieved by the directors. */
finally(goal(D1, U1), S):-
  finally(outcome(D1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(D2, U2), S):-
  finally(outcome(_,_,_,D2,_,U2), S).

This Prolog formulation extends the game model to the new scenario with film directors based on the description provided. It follows a similar structure to the given Prisoner's Dilemma game, with adaptations specific to the new game's rules and payoffs. The clauses are declared discontiguous to accommodate SWI-Prolog's requirement for non-consecutive rule specifications.~
