###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two countries must decide whether to impose strict emission controls or not. If both impose controls, they collaborate to mitigate climate change and safeguard global health. If one imposes controls and the other doesn't, the controlling country bears economic costs and potential job losses, while the non-controlling country enjoys continued economic activity and becomes a polluter. If neither imposes controls, they both avoid economic costs but contribute to worsening climate conditions.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Below is the set of domain-specific axioms for the Climate Control game based on the given verbal description. This code is designed to be compatible with SWI Prolog.

```prolog
@

/* Game specific predicates for Climate Control Game (CCG) */

% Payoff matrix for CCG
payoffCCG('Control', 'Control', 3, 3).
payoffCCG('NoControl', 'Control', 1, 4).
payoffCCG('Control', 'NoControl', 4, 1).
payoffCCG('NoControl', 'NoControl', 2, 2).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1, country1), s0).
initially(role(p2, country2), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'Control'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'NoControl'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, country1), S),   
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),  
    holds(role(P2, country2), S),   
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoffCCG(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
    finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).

In this setup:
- Each player can choose between "Control" or "NoControl".
- The payoff matrix is defined according to the game rules.
- The initial facts define the initial situation, including which player starts in control.
- The `legal`, `possible`, `effect`, and `abnormal` predicates define the rules for legal moves and their effects.

The provided code should integrate seamlessly with the domain-independent situation calculus and enable modeling and testing of legal evolutions of the Climate Control game.~
