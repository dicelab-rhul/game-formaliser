###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two drivers are on a collision course, each deciding whether to swerve (compromise) or keep going straight (hold firm). If both swerve, they avoid the crash and each gets a payoff of 0 units. If one swerves and the other goes straight, the one who swerves is considered a "chicken" and gets -1 unit, while the other gets 1 unit for holding firm. If both go straight, they crash, resulting in a large negative payoff of -10 units for each. This situation, known as the Chicken Game, highlights the risks of brinkmanship and the potential for mutual disaster.


Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
Certainly! Below is a set of domain-specific axioms for the Chicken Game, written in SWI Prolog. The beginning and end of the code are marked with '@', and `:- discontiguous p/3.` is used to ensure that clauses of the same predicate can be distributed throughout the file.

```prolog
@ 

:- discontiguous(final/1).
:- discontiguous(effect/3).
:- discontiguous(abnormal/3).
:- discontiguous(holds/2).
:- discontiguous(possible/2).
:- discontiguous(initially/2).

/* Game specific predicates for Chicken Game (CG) */

% Payoff matrix for CG
payoffCG('S', 'S', 0, 0).
payoffCG('S', 'H', -1, 1).
payoffCG('H', 'S', 1, -1).
payoffCG('H', 'H', -10, -10).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(d1), s0).
initially(player(d2), s0).
initially(role(d1,row), s0).
initially(role(d2,col), s0).
initially(control(d1), s0).
initially(control(d2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_D2, _M2), do(choice(_D1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(D, M), S):- possible(choice(D, M), S), holds(control(D), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(D,'S'), S):- holds(player(D), S).
possible(choice(D,'H'), S):- holds(player(D), S).

% The effects of a move: if D has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(D, M), choice(D, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player loses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(D), choice(D, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(D1,M1,U1,D2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(D1, row), S),	
	holds(did(D1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(D2, col), S),	
	holds(did(D2, M2), S),

% Goals achieved by the players.

	finally(outcome(_,_,_,D2,_,U2), S).

In this code, the Chicken Game's specific rules are defined, including the payoff matrix, the initial state, possible moves, and conditions for final states. This implementation mirrors the structure used for the Prisoner's Dilemma, adapted to the specifics of the Chicken Game. This code should be compatible with SWI Prolog.~
