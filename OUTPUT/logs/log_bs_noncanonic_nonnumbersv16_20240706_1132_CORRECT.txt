###PROMPT##
The following is a Prolog program that can be used to generate and test all legal evolutions of a game represented in the situation calculus:

% All legal evolutions of a game: can be used both as a generator and test.
game(F,F):- final(F).  
game(S,F):- \+ final(S), legal(M,S), game(do(M,S),F).


The domain independent version of the situation calculus is as follows:

% Situation Calculus - our formulation for games.
holds(F, S):- initially(F, S).
holds(F, do(M, S)):- effect(F, M, S).
holds(F, do(A, S)):- holds(F, S), \+ abnormal(F, A, S).

The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick C, you each get 3$. If you choose C while they choose D, you get 1$, and they get 4$. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get 4$, and they get 1$. If you both pick D, you each earn 2$. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:


/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoffPD('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoffPD('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoffPD('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoffPD('C', 'C', 3, 3).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.	
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, row), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),	
	holds(role(P2, col), S),	
	holds(did(P2, M2), S),
	payoffPD(M1, M2, U1, U2).

% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
	finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
	
The verbal decription of another game is as follows:

Two authors co-writing a book are deciding whether to focus on a fantasy genre or a historical fiction genre. One prefers fantasy, and the other prefers historical fiction, but both want to work together. If they both choose to write a fantasy book, the fantasy enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the historical fiction enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they both choose to write a historical fiction book, the historical fiction enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the fantasy enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they choose different genres, they both get no payoff.

Produce set of domain specific axioms for the game. Use numerical payoffs. Mark the beginning and end of the code with a '@'. Write code compatible with SWI Prolog. If the clauses of a specified predicate are not together in the source file, use the discontiguous declaration of SWI:

:- discontiguous p/3.

 at the beginning of the file.

Sure, here is the set of domain-specific axioms for the new game based on the verbal description provided. I will include the necessary declarations and ensure the code is compatible with SWI Prolog.

```prolog
@ 

% Declaration for discontiguous predicates
:- discontiguous player/2, role/2, control/2, possible/2, effect/3, abnormal/3, payoffBook/4, finally/2.

% Payoff matrix for the Book Co-Writing game
payoffBook('F', 'F', 4, 2).
payoffBook('H', 'H', 2, 4).
payoffBook('F', 'H', 0, 0).
payoffBook('H', 'F', 0, 0).

% Initial state
initial(s0).

% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(a1), s0).
initially(player(a2), s0).
initially(role(a1, fantasy), s0).
initially(role(a2, historical), s0).
initially(control(a1), s0).
initially(control(a2), s0).

% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(choice(_P2, _M2), do(choice(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).

% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(choice(P, M), S):- possible(choice(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).

% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(choice(P,'F'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(choice(P,'H'), S):- holds(player(P), S).

% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), choice(P, M), _S).

% The effects of a move: once a choice is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), choice(P, _M), _S).

% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
	final(S),
	holds(role(P1, fantasy), S),	
	holds(did(P1, M1), S),

finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
	finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).

This code initializes the situation and defines the rules and payoffs for the book co-writing game where one author prefers fantasy (F) and the other prefers historical fiction (H). Just like in the prisoner's dilemma example, the predicates describe players, their roles, control states, legal moves, and payoffs, ensuring that the game structure and rules are properly implemented in the situation calculus framework.~
