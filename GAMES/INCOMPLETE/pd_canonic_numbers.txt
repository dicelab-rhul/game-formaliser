Two suspects are arrested and interrogated separately. Each can either confess or remain silent. If both suspects remain silent, they each receive a minor sentence of 1 year in prison. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free while the silent one receives a heavy sentence of 10 years. If both confess, they each receive a moderate sentence of 5 years. This situation, known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, demonstrates how individual rationality can lead to a worse collective outcome.
