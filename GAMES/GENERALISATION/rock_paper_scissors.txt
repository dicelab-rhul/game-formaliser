This simple hand game is played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The winner is determined by the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.
