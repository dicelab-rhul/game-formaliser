A landlord and a tenant are negotiating the terms of a lease renewal. They can either compromise on the rent increase or hold firm on their initial offers. If both compromise, a moderate rent increase is agreed upon. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gets their desired rent or lease terms. If both hold firm, the lease is not renewed, leading the tenant to move out and the landlord to lose rental income temporarily.
