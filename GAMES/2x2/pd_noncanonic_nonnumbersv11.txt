Two roommates must decide whether to consistently clean their shared living spaces or leave the chores to the other. If both share the cleaning duties equally, their home stays tidy, and they maintain a harmonious relationship. If one cleans while the other does not, the cleaner feels resentful and overburdened, while the non-cleaner enjoys a clean home without effort. If neither cleans, they both end up living in a messy environment, causing mutual frustration.
