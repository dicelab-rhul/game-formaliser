Two candidates in the same political party must decide whether to work together to promote a unified platform, aiming for a major electoral win, or to focus on their individual political careers. Collaboration could lead to a landslide victory for the party and prominent roles for both candidates. If one invests in the joint platform while the other focuses on personal gain, the collaborator may struggle to gain traction, while the independent candidate secures a moderate win. If both pursue their own agendas, they risk splitting the vote and both suffering from diluted support.
