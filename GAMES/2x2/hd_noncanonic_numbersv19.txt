Two teams are deciding strategies for a crucial match. Each can either play aggressively or defensively. If both play defensively, the match is a draw, each scoring 0 points. If one plays aggressively while the other plays defensively, the aggressive team wins the match, scoring 6 points, while the defensive team loses, earning -6 points. If both play aggressively, the match becomes disorganized, resulting in injuries and a mutual low score, each earning -3 points.
