Two movie buffs are deciding whether to watch an action movie or a romantic comedy. One prefers the action movie, and the other prefers the romantic comedy, but both prefer watching a movie together over alone. If they both choose the action movie, the action movie fan gets a higher payoff and the romantic comedy fan gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the romantic comedy, the romantic comedy fan gets a higher payoff and the action movie fan gets a lower payoff. If they choose different movies, they both get no payoff.
