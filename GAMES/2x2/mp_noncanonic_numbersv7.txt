A tech startup and a tech giant each independently decide whether to launch a new smart home device or a new wearable gadget. If both choose the same product, the startup wins 3 points, and the tech giant loses 3 points due to increased interest and funding for the startup. If their choices differ, the tech giant wins 4 points, and the startup loses 4 points, with the giant's superior distribution channels and brand recognition tipping the scales.
