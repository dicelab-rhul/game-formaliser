Two startups in the tech industry consider merging their innovative projects to launch a groundbreaking new product. If they collaborate, they could gain substantial market share and venture capital funding. If one startup invests in collaboration while the other sticks to its initial, safer product, the collaborator risks having no product launch, while the independent startup secures moderate sales. If both choose to go it alone, their products may struggle to differentiate in the crowded market, leading to low rewards.
