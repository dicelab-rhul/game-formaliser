A small local store and a national retail chain each decide whether to run a discount on electronics or clothing during a holiday sale. If both choose the same category, the local store attracts budget-conscious shoppers, benefiting at the expense of the national chain. If their promotions don't align, the national chain captures more market share and enjoys higher sales.
