Two nations contemplate signing a mutual defense pact against potential threats. If both sign, they greatly enhance their security for a gain of 4 points each. If one signs and the other does not, the signer is left vulnerable and gains nothing (0 points), while the nonsigner achieves a moderate security benefit worth 2 points owing to reduced regional tensions. If neither sign, they both maintain a minimal security level worth 1 point each.
