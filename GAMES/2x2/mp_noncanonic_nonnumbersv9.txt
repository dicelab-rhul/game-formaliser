An independent film studio and a major Hollywood studio each decide independently whether to release their new film on a coveted holiday weekend or a regular weekend. If both releases coincide, the independent film garners unexpected attention and profits due to genre-specific audiences, affecting the major studio negatively. If the release dates differ, the Hollywood studio enjoys the bulk of the holiday weekend's ticket sales.
