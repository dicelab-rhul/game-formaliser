Two defense contractors must decide whether to bid competitively for a lucrative government contract or price-fix to ensure high profits. If both bid competitively, the government gets a fair deal and both companies maintain integrity but lower profits. If one bids competitively and the other price-fixes, the competitive bidder risks lower profits or loss of the contract, while the price-fixer maximizes their gain. If neither competes and they both price-fix, they secure high profits but risk legal consequences and damaged reputations.
