Two nations in a cold war must decide whether to continue building nuclear arsenals or to mutually disarm. If both build arsenals, they maintain a deterrent but incur huge military costs, each receiving a payoff of 4. If one disarms while the other builds an arsenal, the disarmer risks vulnerability, receiving a payoff of 1, while the builder gains a strategic upper hand, yielding a payoff of 7. If both disarm, they reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and allocate resources to other areas, each receiving a payoff of 6.
