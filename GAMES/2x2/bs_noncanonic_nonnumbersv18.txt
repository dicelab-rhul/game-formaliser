Two tech startups are forming a partnership and need to decide whether to invest in an AI development project or a blockchain technology project. One prefers the AI project, and the other prefers the blockchain project, but both see the value in collaborating on one project. If they both choose the AI project, the AI proponent gets a higher payoff and the blockchain proponent gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the blockchain project, the blockchain proponent gets a higher payoff and the AI proponent gets a lower payoff. If they choose different projects, they both get no payoff.
