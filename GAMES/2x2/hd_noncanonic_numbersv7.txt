Two competing companies are launching new products. Each can either go for aggressive advertising or moderate advertising. If both go moderate, they maintain market share, each earning 0 points. If one goes aggressive while the other goes moderate, the aggressive advertiser captures more market share, earning 4 points, and the moderate advertiser loses market share, earning –4 points. If both go aggressive, they overspend on advertising, negating profits and each earning –20 points.
