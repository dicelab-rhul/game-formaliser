Two film directors have the option to co-direct an ambitious, high-budget movie that could win major awards and box office success. Working together could lead to a masterpiece, earning them both critical acclaim and financial rewards. If one director commits to the joint project and the other focuses on a personal, smaller movie, the collaborator may be left without a finished product, while the independent director sees moderate success. If both direct their own films, they may produce average movies with lower box office returns and limited recognition.
