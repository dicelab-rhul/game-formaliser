Two countries must decide whether to impose strict emission controls or not. If both impose controls, they collaborate to mitigate climate change and safeguard global health. If one imposes controls and the other doesn't, the controlling country bears economic costs and potential job losses, while the non-controlling country enjoys continued economic activity and becomes a polluter. If neither imposes controls, they both avoid economic costs but contribute to worsening climate conditions.
