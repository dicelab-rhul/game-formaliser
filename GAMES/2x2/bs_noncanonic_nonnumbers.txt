Two friends are deciding whether to go shopping at Elegance Boutique or Chic Couture. One prefers the Elegance Boutique, and the other prefers Chic Couture, but both prefer shopping together over going alone. If they both choose the Elegance Boutique, the Elegance Boutique lover gets a higher payoff and the Chic Couture lover gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the Chic Couture, the Chic Couture lover gets a higher payoff and the Elegance Boutique lover gets a lower payoff. If they choose different events, they both get no payoff.
