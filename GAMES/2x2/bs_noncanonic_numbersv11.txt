Two generals are planning the next move in a military operation. One prefers the “North Ridge” route for its defensibility, while the other favors the “South Valley” for its speed. Both understand that coordinating their troops is more crucial than going solo. If they take the “North Ridge” route, the general advocating for it gets 2 points, and the South Valley proponent gets 1 point. If they opt for the “South Valley,” the supporter of this route gets 2 points, and the North Ridge advocate gets 1 point. If they execute different plans, both strategies fail, and they earn 0 points each.
