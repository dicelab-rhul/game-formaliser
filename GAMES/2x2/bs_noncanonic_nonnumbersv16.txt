Two authors co-writing a book are deciding whether to focus on a fantasy genre or a historical fiction genre. One prefers fantasy, and the other prefers historical fiction, but both want to work together. If they both choose to write a fantasy book, the fantasy enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the historical fiction enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they both choose to write a historical fiction book, the historical fiction enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the fantasy enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they choose different genres, they both get no payoff.
