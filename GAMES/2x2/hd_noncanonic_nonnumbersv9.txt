Two opposing military leaders are planning their next moves in a conflict. They can either compromise and seek a truce or hold firm on their aggressive strategies. If both compromise, a ceasefire is agreed upon. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gains a strategic advantage. If both hold firm, ongoing warfare continues, resulting in higher casualties and prolonged conflict.
