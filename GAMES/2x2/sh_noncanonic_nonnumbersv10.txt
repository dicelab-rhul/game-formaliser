Two players on a soccer team can either work together to practice and strategize for a crucial game, aiming for a championship win, or focus on their individual skills and performance. By teaming up and enhancing their coordination, they could lead their team to victory and gain fame and lucrative contracts. If one invests in the collaborative effort and the other focuses on personal training, the first player might see no improvement in team performance, while the solo player gains a moderate benefit. If both prioritize their individual practice, the team's overall performance suffers, leading to a lower ranking and limited rewards.
