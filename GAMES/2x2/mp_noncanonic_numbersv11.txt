An independent bookstore and a national bookstore chain each decide whether to heavily promote a new fiction novel or a new non-fiction book. If both promote the same genre, the independent bookstore gains 2 points, and the chain loses 2 points due to the independent store's stronger local relationships and community loyalty. If their promotions differ, the chain bookstore gains 3 points, and the independent store loses 3 points due to the chain's vast reach and promotional resources.
