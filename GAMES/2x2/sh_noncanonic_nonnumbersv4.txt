Two scientists are given the opportunity to work together on a high-risk, high-reward research grant. By combining their skills and knowledge, they might make a groundbreaking discovery, earning them both prestigious awards and grants. If one invests in this collaborative project while the other works on a safer, individually-focused project, the collaborator may see no results while the independent researcher secures a moderate publication. If both choose individual paths, they produce incremental findings and receive lesser recognition.
