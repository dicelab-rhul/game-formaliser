Two countries must decide whether to adhere to a disarmament treaty. If both comply, they ensure regional stability and mutual trust without the threat of escalation. If one complies and the other doesn't, the compliant country feels betrayed and vulnerable, while the non-compliant one gains a strategic advantage. If neither complies, they both continue an arms race, increasing tensions and risks of conflict.
