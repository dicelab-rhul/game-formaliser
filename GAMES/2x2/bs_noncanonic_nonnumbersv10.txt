Two roommates are deciding whether to go out for dinner at an Italian restaurant or a Japanese restaurant. One prefers Italian cuisine, and the other prefers Japanese cuisine, but both enjoy dining together. If they both choose the Italian restaurant, the Italian food lover gets a higher payoff and the Japanese food lover gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the Japanese restaurant, the Japanese food lover gets a higher payoff and the Italian food lover gets a lower payoff. If they choose different restaurants, they both get no payoff.
