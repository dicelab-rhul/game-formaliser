Two neighbors must decide whether to report their true income on their taxes or underreport to pay less. If both report truthfully, they contribute fairly to public services and avoid legal trouble. If one reports truthfully and the other underreports, the honest taxpayer feels cheated and subsidizes the public services for both. If neither reports accurately, they both save money but contribute to public service deficits and risk severe penalties if caught.
