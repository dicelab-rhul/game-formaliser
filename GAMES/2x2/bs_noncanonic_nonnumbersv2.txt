Two business executives are deciding whether to attend a conference on technology or a seminar on market trends. One prefers the technology conference, and the other prefers the market trends seminar, but both value the networking opportunities of attending the same event. If they both choose the technology conference, the tech enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the market trends enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the market trends seminar, the market trends enthusiast gets a higher payoff and the tech enthusiast gets a lower payoff. If they choose different events, they both get no payoff.
