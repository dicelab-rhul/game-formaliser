Two chefs in a cooking show work on a competition dish. They can either collaborate to create an innovative dish or work independently on safer, less ambitious dishes. If both collaborate, they both achieve a high reward. If one collaborates while the other works independently, the collaborator gains nothing and the independent worker earns a moderate reward. If both work independently, they each receive a low reward.
