Two chefs in a cooking show work on a competition dish. They can either collaborate to create an innovative dish or work independently on safer, less ambitious dishes. If both collaborate, they achieve a high reward, each receiving a promotion worth 3 points. If one collaborates while the other works independently, the collaborator gains nothing (0 points) and the independent worker earns a moderate reward (2 points). If both work independently, they each receive a low reward of 1 point.
