An independent bookstore and a major bookstore chain independently decide to prominently display either a newly-released mystery novel or a romance novel. If their displays match, the independent bookstore benefits from attracting curious readers looking for unique selections, impacting the chainâ€™s usual customer base. When the displays differ, the chain profits from its diverse and appealing selection to a large audience.
