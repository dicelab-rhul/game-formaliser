A coach from a lesser-known college basketball team and one from a top university strategically plan for the next big game by independently choosing to focus either on aggressive offense or strong defense. If their strategies match, the lesser-known team's coach outsmarts the competition and their team gains notoriety. If the strategies differ, the top universityâ€™s team uses their superior resources to dominate the game, thus profiting from the win.
