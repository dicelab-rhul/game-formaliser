A couple is deciding how to spend their evening together. One prefers to go to the opera and the other prefers to go to a football game, but both prefer to be together rather than apart. If they both choose the opera, the opera lover gets a higher payoff and the football lover gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the football game, the football lover gets a higher payoff and the opera lover gets a lower payoff. If they choose different events, they both get no payoff. This situation, known as the Battle of the Sexes, reflects the challenges of coordinating when preferences differ.
