A vendor and a retailer are negotiating the wholesale price of a product. They can either compromise on the price or hold firm on their initial offers. If both compromise, a fair wholesale price is agreed upon. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gets a more favorable price. If both hold firm, no deal is made, resulting in the retailer not stocking the product and the vendor losing potential sales.
