Two corporations must decide whether to implement costly sustainable practices or continue cheaper, unsustainable methods. If both adopt sustainable practices, they build better reputations and contribute to environmental preservation. If one does and the other doesnâ€™t, the adopter incurs higher costs and may lose competitive pricing, while the non-adopter enjoys lower costs and possible short-term gains. If neither adopts sustainable practices, they both save money but contribute to environmental degradation and potential future regulatory issues.
