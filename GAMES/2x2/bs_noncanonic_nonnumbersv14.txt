Two friends with different music tastes are deciding whether to attend a rock concert or a jazz festival. One prefers rock music, and the other prefers jazz, but both value enjoying music together. If they both choose the rock concert, the rock fan gets a higher payoff and the jazz fan gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the jazz festival, the jazz fan gets a higher payoff and the rock fan gets a lower payoff. If they choose different events, they both get no payoff.
