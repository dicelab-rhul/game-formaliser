A couple must decide whether to adopt environmentally friendly but costly habits or stick with their current, cheaper habits. If both adopt the new habits, they share a sense of mutual accomplishment and avoid environmental guilt. If one adopts it and the other doesn't, the adopter incurs higher costs and feels a sense of betrayal, while the non-adopter avoids extra costs and gains a short-term advantage. If neither adopts, they avoid the higher costs but risk feeling collective guilt.
