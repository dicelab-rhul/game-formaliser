A small renewable energy startup and a large traditional energy company each decide whether to invest in wind power projects or solar power projects. If both invest in the same type of project, the renewable startup wins 5 points, and the traditional energy company loses 5 points, marking a public relations win for the sustainable choice. If their investments differ, the traditional energy company wins 4 points, and the renewable startup loses 4 points, as the larger company can leverage its extensive financial resources and existing infrastructure.
