A couple must decide whether to adopt environmentally friendly but costly habits or stick with their current, cheaper habits. If both adopt the new habits, they share a sense of mutual accomplishment and avoid environmental guilt, each receiving a payoff of 5. If one adopts it and the other doesn't, the adopter incurs higher costs and feels a sense of betrayal, resulting in a payoff of 2 while the non-adopter avoids extra costs and gains a short-term advantage, receiving a payoff of 8. If neither adopts, they avoid the higher costs but risk feeling collective guilt, each receiving a payoff of 3.
