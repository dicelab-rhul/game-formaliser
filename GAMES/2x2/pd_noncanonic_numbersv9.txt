Two rival corporations must decide whether to engage in industrial espionage. If both engage in espionage, they risk legal consequences and create an atmosphere of distrust, each receiving a payoff of 2. If one engages in espionage while the other refrains, the spy gains a competitive edge with sensitive information, receiving a payoff of 7, while the non-spy suffers from a loss of trade secrets, getting a payoff of 1. If neither engages in espionage, they maintain a fair competition and avoid risks, each receiving a payoff of 5.
