Two rival political candidates must decide whether to engage in mudslinging during their campaign. If both engage in mudslinging, they degrade the political discourse and might turn off voters, each receiving a payoff of 3. If one mudslings and the other runs a clean campaign, the mudslinger might tarnish the opponent's reputation and win more votes, receiving a payoff of 8, while the clean campaigner receives a payoff of 2. If neither engages in mudslinging, they uphold higher moral standards but miss the opportunity to undermine their opponent, each candidates getting a payoff of 5.
