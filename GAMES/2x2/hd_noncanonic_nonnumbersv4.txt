An employee and employer are negotiating a salary increase. Both can either compromise or hold firm on their demands. If both compromise, the employee receives a moderate raise. If the employee holds firm and the employer compromises, the employee gets a substantial raise. If both hold firm, the negotiation breaks down, potentially resulting in the employee leaving the company, thereby impacting both sides negatively.
