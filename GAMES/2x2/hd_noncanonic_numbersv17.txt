Two countries are negotiating CO2 emission reductions. Each can either stick to high emissions or agree to cuts. If both agree to cuts, environmental benefits are neutral, and they receive 0 points. If one sticks to high emissions while the other agrees to cuts, the high-emission country gains economic advantages worth 4 points, while the cutting country faces economic drawbacks worth -4 points. If both stick to high emissions, global warming effects worsen, and each suffers -10 points.
