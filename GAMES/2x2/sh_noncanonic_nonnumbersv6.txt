During a critical campaign, two allied generals must decide whether to plan a joint, large-scale attack or to conduct separate, safer operations. Coordinating their forces could lead to a decisive victory with considerable strategic advantage and medals of honor. If one general commits to the joint attack and the other does not, the first general's forces might be left exposed, achieving nothing, while the other gains a modest victory. If both pursue independent missions, they achieve minor successes but fail to make a significant impact.
