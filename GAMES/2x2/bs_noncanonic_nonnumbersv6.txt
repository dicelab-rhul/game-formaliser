Two politicians from allied parties are deciding whether to support a new healthcare bill or an education reform bill. One prefers healthcare reform, and the other prefers education reform, but both prefer presenting a united front. If they both support the healthcare bill, the healthcare advocate gets a higher payoff and the education advocate gets a lower payoff. If they both support the education bill, the education advocate gets a higher payoff and the healthcare advocate gets a lower payoff. If they choose different bills to support, they both get no payoff.
