Two generals are planning a joint military operation and need to decide whether to attack the northern front or the eastern front. One prefers the northern front, and the other prefers the eastern front, but both prioritize the success of a coordinated attack. If they both choose the northern front, the northern strategy advocate gets a higher payoff and the eastern strategy advocate gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the eastern front, the eastern strategy advocate gets a higher payoff and the northern strategy advocate gets a lower payoff. If they choose different fronts, they both get no payoff.
