Two political parties debate forming a coalition to push through crucial legislation. If both parties commit, they successfully pass impactful laws, leading to significant public approval worth 6 points each. If one commits while the other pursues its agenda, the committed party sees its efforts diluted, gaining nothing (0 points), and the non-committed party achieves moderate gains from their independent policies worth 3 points. If neither cooperates, each party struggles to pass minor laws, resulting in a small public approval gain of 2 points each.
