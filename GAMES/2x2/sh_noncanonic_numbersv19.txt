Two film directors are approached to co-direct a high-budget, potentially award-winning film. If both commit to the project, they produce a critically acclaimed movie, each earning prestigious awards worth 7 points. If one devotes full effort while the other disengages, the committed director's vision gets compromised, and they gain nothing (0 points), while the disengaged director reaps moderate career benefits worth 3 points from other projects. If they both decide to focus on their films rather than collaborate, they produce average movies, earning minimal critical acclaim worth 2 points each.
