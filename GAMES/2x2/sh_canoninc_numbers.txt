Two hunters are out in the woods and must decide whether to hunt a stag together (collaborate) or hunt a hare alone (act independently). If both collaborate to hunt the stag, they each receive a large reward of 3 units of meat. If one collaborates while the other hunts a hare, the collaborator gets nothing (0 units) and the independent hunter gets a moderate reward of 2 units. If both hunt hares independently, they each receive a small reward of 1 unit. This situation, known as the Stag Hunt, illustrates the tension between mutual cooperation for a higher reward and individual action for a guaranteed but lower reward.
