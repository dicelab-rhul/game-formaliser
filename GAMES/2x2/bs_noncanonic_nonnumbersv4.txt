A married couple is deciding whether to go on a beach vacation or a mountain retreat. One prefers the beach, and the other prefers the mountains, but both cherish spending time together. If they both choose the beach vacation, the beach lover gets a higher payoff and the mountain lover gets a lower payoff. If they both choose the mountain retreat, the mountain lover gets a higher payoff and the beach lover gets a lower payoff. If they choose different destinations, they both get no payoff.
