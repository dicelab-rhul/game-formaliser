Two siblings are negotiating the division of their inherited property. They can either compromise and share the assets equitably or hold firm on getting specific desired items. If both compromise, they split the inheritance fairly. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gets the desired assets. If both hold firm, the inheritance remains unsettled, leading to potential legal disputes and family discord.
