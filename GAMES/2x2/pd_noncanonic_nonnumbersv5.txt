Two rival companies in the same industry must decide whether to invest in expensive but cutting-edge technology or stick to current methods. If both invest, they stay competitive and advance the industry standards. If one invests and the other doesn't, the investor faces high costs and risks, while the non-investor saves money and temporarily gains market share. If neither invests, they save costs but fall behind competitors adopting new technologies.
