Two environmental organizations are faced with a major conservation challenge, such as saving an endangered species. By joining forces, they can pool resources and expertise to create a comprehensive conservation plan, leading to a high reward of media attention, funding, and notable success. If one organization devotes efforts to the joint project while the other focuses on smaller, guaranteed projects, the collaborator might see their effort go to waste, while the other organization secures a moderate reward. If both work independently, they achieve smaller, localized successes and gain minimal recognition.
