Two military commanders must decide whether to focus on offense or defense. If both choose defense, they secure their positions with 0 points. If one goes on offense and the other remains defensive, the offensive commander gains territory and resources worth 5 points, while the defensive commander suffers losses worth -5 points. If both go on offense, they exhaust their resources without significant gain, resulting in each receiving -15 points.
