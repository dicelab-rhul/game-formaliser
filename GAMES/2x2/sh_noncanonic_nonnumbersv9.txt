Two pharmaceutical companies are presented with the chance to develop a novel drug through a partnership. By combining their research and development capabilities, they could potentially create a blockbuster drug, receiving regulatory approval and massive profits. If one company dedicates itself to this partnership while the other pursues incremental improvements on existing drugs, the collaborator risks significant losses, while the other company enjoys moderate gains. If both focus on their independent projects, they produce small advancements with limited financial returns.
