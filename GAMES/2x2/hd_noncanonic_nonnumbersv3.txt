Two political parties are considering forming a coalition government. They can either compromise on policy positions or hold firm on their primary agendas. If both compromise, a moderate platform is developed that addresses key concerns of both parties. If one party holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder's policies dominate the coalition's agenda. If both parties hold firm, no coalition is formed, leading to political instability and potential gridlock in governance.
