A small electric vehicle company and a large traditional car manufacturer each decide whether to invest in developing a new electric sedan or a new electric SUV. If both companies decide on the same type of vehicle, the small company gains a 10% market share, and the large manufacturer loses 10% due to consumers favoring the innovation and eco-friendliness of the smaller player. If their choices differ, the large manufacturer gains a 15% market share, and the small company loses 15%, as the large manufacturer can leverage its established sales network.
