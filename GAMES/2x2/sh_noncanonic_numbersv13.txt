Two allied generals face the decision to launch a coordinated attack on a fortified enemy position. If both launch the attack together, they stand a high chance of success, securing strategic advantage worth 9 points each. If one commits to the attack while the other hesitates, the committed general's forces suffer heavy losses with a gain of 0 points, while the cautious general gains a small strategic hold worth 4 points. If both hesitate, they miss the opportunity, gaining only minimal positioning benefit worth 2 points each.
