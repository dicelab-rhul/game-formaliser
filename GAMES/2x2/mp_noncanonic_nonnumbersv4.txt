In a conflict-stricken region, two warlords must independently decide whether to attack or defend a particular strategic outpost. If both decide to attack or both to defend, the weaker warlord gains a strategic advantage, causing challenges for the stronger warlord. If their strategies differ, the stronger warlord consolidates their power by either successfully defending or easily taking the outpost.
