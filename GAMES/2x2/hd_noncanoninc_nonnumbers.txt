A husband and a wife are negotiating over a family budget. Each can either compromise or hold firm. If both compromise, a moderate family budget is accepted. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder gets more of their priorities covered. If both hold firm, the family budget fails, leading to an inability to cover all necessary expenses.
