Two drivers are on a collision course, each deciding whether to swerve (compromise) or keep going straight (hold firm). If both swerve, they avoid the crash and each gets a neutral payoff. If one swerves and the other goes straight, the one who swerves is considered a "chicken" and gets a negative payoff, while the other gets a positive payoff for holding firm. If both go straight, they crash, resulting in a large negative payoff for each. This situation, known as the Chicken Game, highlights the risks of brinkmanship and the potential for mutual disaster.
