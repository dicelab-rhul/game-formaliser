A boutique digital marketing agency and a huge marketing firm each independently decide whether to focus their efforts on a viral social media campaign or a high-profile influencer partnership. If both agencies choose the same strategy, the boutique agency wins 4 points, and the large firm loses 4 points, with the boutique agency being viewed as trendier and more in touch with cutting-edge strategies. If their choices differ, the large firm wins 6 points, and the boutique agency loses 6 points due to the large firmâ€™s broader reach and more substantial influence.
