Two logging companies have the option to enforce sustainable practices to preserve the forest. If both adopt these practices, the forest thrives, providing long-term benefits worth 7 points each. If one adopts sustainable practices and the other does not, the sustainably operating company faces higher costs and gains nothing (0 points), while the non-sustainable company benefits from immediate profits worth 4 points. If neither uses sustainable practices, they overexploit the forest, securing short-term gains of 3 points each but risking long-term depletion.
