Two project managers within a company are assigned to develop a groundbreaking software. They can either collaborate to pool their expertise and resources, resulting in a revolutionary product and significant bonuses, or work separately on minor updates to existing software. If one collaborates and the other doesn't, the collaborator's effort may be wasted, resulting in no significant achievement, while the one working independently earns a modest bonus. If both choose to work independently, the company's software portfolio remains stagnant, and both managers receive minimal rewards.
