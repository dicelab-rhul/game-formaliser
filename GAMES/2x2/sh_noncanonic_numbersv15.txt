Two tech companies consider pooling resources to develop a cutting-edge technology. If both agree, they achieve a major technological breakthrough, earning 10 points each. If one commits and the other pulls back, the committed company sees its investment go to waste with 0 points, while the non-committed gains a moderate technological advancement worth 5 points from focusing on easier projects. If both avoid the risk and work independently, they come up with incremental improvements worth 4 points each.
