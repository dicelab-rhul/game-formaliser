Two neighboring cities must decide whether to jointly fund a major infrastructure project like a bridge that benefits both. If both cities fund the project, they share the costs and benefits, each receiving a payoff of 6. If one city funds the project while the other does not, the funding city bears the full cost but still benefits from the use of the bridge, receiving a payoff of 4, while the non-funding city benefits without any cost, receiving a payoff of 8. If neither city funds the project, the bridge is not built, and both cities receive a payoff of 0.
