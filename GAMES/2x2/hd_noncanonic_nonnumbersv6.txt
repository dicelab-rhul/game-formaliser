Two countries are negotiating international environmental policies. They can either compromise on emission reductions or hold firm on their national interests. If both compromise, a balanced environmental policy is established. If one country holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder benefits more from the agreement. If both hold firm, no agreement is reached, exacerbating environmental degradation.
