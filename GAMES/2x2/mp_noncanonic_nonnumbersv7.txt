A local newspaper and a national newspaper independently choose whether to feature a scandalous local event or a major international story on their front page. If both choose the same, the local newspaper gains readership interested in a fresh take on familiar news, while the national paper loses some of its readership's interest. If their choices differ, the national newspaper maintains its broad audience appeal, thereby increasing its profits.
