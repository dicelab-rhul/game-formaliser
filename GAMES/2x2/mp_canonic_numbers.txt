Two players each decide independently whether to choose heads or tails. If their choices match, one player wins 1 unit, and the other loses 1 unit, as it is a zero-sum game. If their choices differ, the other player wins 1 unit and the first player loses 1 unit. This scenario, known as Matching Pennies, represents a situation where each player's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other player.
