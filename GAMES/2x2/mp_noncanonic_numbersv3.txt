A local coffee shop and a large coffee chain both independently decide whether to launch a new signature latte or a new cold brew. If both shops release the same new drink, the local coffee shop wins 2 points, and the large coffee chain loses 2 points due to the novelty appeal boosting the smaller shop's reputation. If their choices differ, the large coffee chain wins 3 points, and the local coffee shop loses 3 points since the larger chain can dominate the market with its more extensive advertising power.
