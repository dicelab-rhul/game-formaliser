Two enemy nations must decide whether to exchange captured spies or not. If both agree to the exchange, they regain their spies and set a precedent for future exchanges, promoting a degree of mutual respect. If one agrees to the exchange and the other reneges, the compliant nation feels duped and loses leverage, while the reneging nation retains its spy and gains a tactical advantage. If neither agrees to the exchange, both spies remain in captivity, escalating hostilities and mistrust.
