Two business partners are negotiating the expansion strategy for their company. They can either compromise by integrating both their ideas or hold firm on their individual strategies. If both compromise, a balanced expansion plan is adopted. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm holder's strategy is prioritized. If both hold firm, they fail to agree on an expansion strategy, leading to lost opportunities and potential market stagnation.
